## Purpose
Project Frontiers is inspired by the Battle Frontier from some older Pokémon games, like Pokémon Emerald (2005), Pokémon Platinum (2008), and Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver (2009).
The Battle Frontier was a location where players could participate in special combat challenges with their Pokémon; for instance, in the Battle Tower challenge, players will face
several opponents back-to-back, while, in the Battle Pyramid challenge, players will traverse a dark dungeon where they can come across challenges to get rewards, such as hints
about the dungeon's layout, or items to help the player succeed in the challenge.

With Project Frontier, I aim to create a full-fledged game with a system similar to the Battle Frontier as its main focus. Although
the intricacies of the combat system will be largely based on that of Pokémon Emerald (2005), it will include newer characters, items,
and skills for players to make use of, while still maintaining the spirit of Pokémon Emerald's gameplay.

Project Frontiers will not be monetized.

## Graphics, Visuals, and Aesthetics
The graphical features of the game are essentially in the planning phase, but the general aesthetic of the game aims to replicate that of
Pokémon Emerald as well. Here is an example of how this might look: https://youtu.be/uvlWKOf7aeE?si=CoTch6Mw-qKNoXbk&t=40

As far as sprites (2D character models) are concerned, characters with existing sprites in Pokémon Emerald will have their sprites from
that game used, while characters from newer Pokémon games will have sprites commissioned in the art style of those in Pokémon Emerald for
use in Project Frontiers exclusively.
